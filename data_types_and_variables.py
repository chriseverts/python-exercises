##1 You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days), Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it). If price for a movie per day is 3 dollars, how much will you have to pay?

vars littlemermaid = 3*3; ## variables

vars brotherbear = 5*3;

vars  Hercules = 1*3;

priceofmovies (a,b,c) 
return littlemermaid + brotherbear + Hercules; ## addition of variables.

##2 Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and Facebook, they pay you a different rate per hour. Google pays 400 dollars per hour, Amazon 380, and Facebook 350.

google = 400 * 6

amazon = 380 * 4

facebook = 350 * 10

def company(a,b,c,):   
    return (google + amazon + facebook)

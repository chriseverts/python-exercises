## 1. Conditional Basics

####prompt the user for a day of the week, print out whether the day is Monday or not

##prompt the user for a day of the week, print out whether the day is a weekday or a weekend

##create variables and make up values for the number of hours worked in one week
##the hourly rate
##how much the week's paycheck will be
##write the python code that calculates the weekly paycheck. You get paid time and a half if you work more than 40 hours


day_of_week = 'Monday'

If day_of_week == 'Monday':
    print('Yes')
elif(day_of_week == 'Tuesday':
    print('No')
elif(day_of_week == 'Wensday':
    print('No')
elif(day_of_week == 'Thursday':
    print('No')
elif(day_of_week == 'Friday':
    print('No')
elif(day_of_week == 'Saturday':
    print('No')
elif(day_of_week == 'Sunday':
    print('No')
else:



##2 Loop Basics

##While

##Create an integer variable i with a value of 5.
##Create a while loop that runs so long as i is less than or equal to 15
##Each loop iteration, output the current value of i, then increment i by one.




i = 5
while i <= 15:
    print(i)
    i += 1

i = 0
while i <= 100:
    print(i)
    i += 2

i = 100
while i >= -10:
    print(i)
    i -= 5

i = 2
while i <= 1_000_000:
    print(i)
    i = i ** 2

x = (input("Please enter a number:"))

for i in range(1, 11):  
        print("{x} x {i} = {x * i}")
